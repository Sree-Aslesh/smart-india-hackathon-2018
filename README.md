# smart-india-hackathon-2018

Smart India Hackathon is Worldâ€™s Biggest Open Innovation Model that aims to provide a platform for technology students to offer innovative solutions for pressing problems which we face in our daily lives, thus inculcating a culture of product innovation and a mindset of problem-solving. Our team participated to address the problem statement of low-cost automated parcel sorting. This is a major problem of the postal department in rural and many urban areas of India which deals with an enormous amount of postal traffic every day. Such a vast quantity of letters and couriers are handled manually. The reason for this being that the automated solutions are way too expensive and the government has neither the budget nor the time to install and utilize such equipment.

The couriers are being handled by people and are being sorted based on human knowledge of places. This can give rise to erroneous sorting operation as humans have a tendency to error even in the simplest of tasks to the most minute percentage. Yet, a small mishap maybe insignificant for a day's sorting of parcels but the number increases tenfold when the mistakes are measured over a longer period of time. To reduce these errors we introduce a low-budget solution for parcel sorting which will increase efficiency, reduce costs and money spent on labour.

The video above is a 2-d implementation of the solution that our team proposed. Each flap ( shown in red ) was mounted on a heavy-duty motor that rotates causing the flaps to open and close as desired. The biggest advantage of such a solution is that gravity does all the hard work of moving the parcels or couriers. There are bags attached at the end of each pipeline for sorting the couriers. They are sorted on the basis of their pin codes. This proposed solution in for the secondary sorting. This Idea led us to win the 1st runner position in the competition and a prize of Rs. 75,000.
